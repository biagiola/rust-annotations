Summary about generic lifetimes

Not quite “two lifetimes on main” in the sense of you having to write them, but you do have two distinct borrow scopes:

&cities borrow starts when you call

rust
Copy
Edit
let two_cities = select_first_two_elements(&cities);
and lasts until two_cities (or all uses of it) go out of scope at the end of main.

&coffees borrow begins inside the inner { … } block and ends when that block closes.

Under the hood, each call to

rust
Copy
Edit
fn select_first_two_elements<'a>(items: &'a [String]) -> &'a [String]
gets its own concrete 'a tied to the lifetime of the argument you passed in. But you never annotate main itself—Rust infers all of that for you.

can you explain me again all the theory about the 'a and the lifetimes on main.

Let’s pull the threads together and see what’s really happening with that ’a and the two borrows in main. We’ll cover:

What a lifetime parameter ('a) really is

How it ties inputs to outputs

What “two lifetimes” in main looks like

Why you don’t (and can’t) annotate main itself

1. Lifetimes are compile-time “bookmarks,” not runtime things
A lifetime is just a generic parameter on references that tells the compiler how long that reference is valid.

It doesn’t affect the generated code: it’s purely for the borrow checker.

When you write:

rust
Copy
Edit
fn select_first_two<'a>(items: &'a [String]) -> &'a [String] { … }
– you’re saying “for some lifetime 'a, I take a reference valid for 'a and return a reference also valid for 'a.”
– Think of 'a like a function-local type variable: you never pick what it is—that happens at call time.

2. Tying inputs to outputs
Rust’s borrow checker enforces that every returned reference must be valid for the entire lifetime you claim. By writing -> &'a [String], you promise “I’m not returning a pointer to something that drops sooner than 'a.”

Bad: returning &local_value would promise the caller a reference valid outside the function, but the data is dropped at function exit → error.

Good: returning a slice of something the caller owns, so the caller controls the outer scope and can guarantee it outlives 'a.

3. Two calls ⇒ two instantiations of 'a
In your main:

rust
Copy
Edit
let two_cities  = select_first_two_elements(&cities);
{ 
    let two_coffees = select_first_two_elements(&coffees);
    // …  
}
Call #1: &cities has some anonymous lifetime—call it 'city_scope.

The compiler instantiates the function as

rust
Copy
Edit
fn select_first_two_elements<'city_scope>(items: &'city_scope [String]) -> &'city_scope [String]
The borrow of cities (and thus two_cities) must live until the end of main, because two_cities is used there.

Call #2: inside the inner block, &coffees has a shorter lifetime—call it 'coffee_scope.

The compiler also instantiates

rust
Copy
Edit
fn select_first_two_elements<'coffee_scope>(items: &'coffee_scope [String]) -> &'coffee_scope [String]
That borrow must end when the block closes, and you cannot use two_coffees after that.

Even though both use the same source code with <'a>, at compile time Rust treats them as two separate generics ('city_scope vs 'coffee_scope).

4. You don’t (and can’t) write lifetimes on main
Rust only requires explicit lifetimes in signatures where multiple references could be tied together ambiguously.

main never needs an explicit lifetime because you’re not returning references from main—you’re only creating borrows inside it.

Borrow scopes in main are inferred by where you call and where you last use the reference:

text
Copy
Edit
let two_cities = …;          // borrow starts here …
println!(… two_cities …);    // … and ends after this last use

{                             // new inner scope
  let two_coffees = …;        // coffee borrow starts
  println!(… two_coffees …);  // coffee borrow ends here
}                             // coffees go out of scope
TL;DR
'a in your function signature is a placeholder lifetime that the compiler fills in on each call.

Each borrow in main gets its own concrete lifetime—one for cities, one for coffees.

You only annotate functions that return or accept references; you never annotate main.

The borrow checker then ensures that no returned reference can outlive the data it points to.

Once you see lifetimes as static bookkeeping to guarantee safety, rather than something that lives at runtime, it all clicks into place. 🌟
