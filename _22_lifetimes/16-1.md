# Single Lifetime Parameters

Both `15.rs` and `16.rs` use the **same single lifetime annotation** (`'a`), but they demonstrate **different scenarios** where it works:

## When to use a single lifetime (`'a`)

Use one lifetime when the **return value could come from any of the input parameters**, and you want the borrow checker to be **conservative** and pick the **shortest** lifetime:

**15.rs - Same Scope:**
```rust
fn longest<'a>(first: &'a str, second: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    // Could return either first OR second
    if first.len() > second.len() { first } else { second }
}

fn main() {
    let orlando = String::from("Orlando"); // Lives until end of main
    let san_francisco = String::from("San Francisco"); // Lives until end of main
    let result = longest(&orlando, &san_francisco);
    println!("{result}");
}
```

**16.rs - Different Scopes:**
```rust
fn longest<'a>(first: &'a str, second: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    // Could return either first OR second
    if first.len() > second.len() { first } else { second }
}

fn main() {
    let orlando = String::from("Orlando"); // Lives until end of main
    {
        let san_francisco = String::from("San Francisco"); // Dies at end of inner scope
        let result = longest(&orlando, &san_francisco);

        println!("{result}"); // Used only within inner scope

    }
    // ...
    println!("{orlando}"); // orlando still alive
}
// they still overlap thier lifetimes on the inner scope,
// this will be a valid reference regarless
// of which string it is providing a reference to.
```
## How Single `'a` Handles Both Cases

The single lifetime annotation `'a` works differently in each case:

### In 15.rs:
- Both variables live until end of `main`
- `'a` = "from start until end of main"
- `result` could safely be used anywhere in `main`

### In 16.rs:
- `orlando` lives until end of `main`
- `san_francisco` only lives until end of inner scope
- **`'a` = "the overlapping region" = inner scope only**
- `result` can only be used within the inner scope

## The Borrow Checker's Logic

With single `'a`, the borrow checker says:

> "I don't know which reference you'll return (`orlando` or `san_francisco`), so I must assume the returned reference lives only as long as the **shorter-lived** input."

**In 15.rs:** Both inputs live equally long → `'a` = full main scope
**In 16.rs:** `san_francisco` is shorter → `'a` = inner scope only

## Why This Matters

**16.rs demonstrates a crucial concept:** Even when one variable lives much longer than another, the single `'a` annotation **restricts** the return value to the overlapping lifetime. This is **conservative but safe**.

**What wouldn't work - Example from 17.rs:**
```rust
fn main() {
    let orlando = String::from("Orlando");
    
    let result = {
        let san_francisco = String::from("San Francisco");
        longest(&orlando, &san_francisco) // ❌ ERROR: borrowed value does not live long enough
        // here we have a possibility of dangling reference coz, we can return
        // san_francisco to set into the result variable, but we can delete that one
        // when we finish this scope. Result has the potential of hold a dangling
        // reference.
    };
    // result would be used here, but san_francisco is already dropped
}
```

**Another example that also fails:**
```rust
fn main() {
    let orlando = String::from("Orlando");
    let result;  // Declared outside
    {
        let san_francisco = String::from("San Francisco");
        result = longest(&orlando, &san_francisco);  // ❌ ERROR!
    }
    println!("{}", result);  // ❌ Trying to use result outside inner scope
}
```

Both examples fail because the borrow checker thinks `result` might point to `san_francisco`, which gets dropped when the inner scope ends. The single `'a` lifetime annotation forces the compiler to be conservative and assume the worst case.

## Summary

- **Same annotation (`'a`)** in both files
- **Different behavior** based on actual variable lifetimes
- **15.rs:** Shows `'a` when inputs have same lifetime
- **16.rs:** Shows `'a` picking the shorter lifetime (overlapping region)
- **Key insight:** Single `'a` always picks the most restrictive (shortest) lifetime to guarantee safety

**What happens:** The borrow checker says "I don't know which one you'll return, so I'll assume the returned reference lives only as long as the **shorter** of the two inputs."
