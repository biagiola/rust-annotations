This little file is a compact illustration of three core language ideas that work together in Rust:  
• traits as interfaces (`Add`)  
• generic functions with trait bounds (`T: Add<Output = T>`)  
• monomorphisation, the compile-time process that makes those generics “zero-cost”.

What the code does mechanically is straightforward: `add_two_numbers` can add any two values of the same type as long as the type implements the standard-library trait `Add` and promises that the result of `a + b` is also that same type. The interesting part is everything Rust is doing underneath to make that possible without runtime penalties.

1 The `Add` trait  
`std::ops::Add` is the trait that powers the `+` operator. Its simplified definition looks like:

```rust
pub trait Add<Rhs = Self> {
    type Output;                 // associated type
    fn add(self, rhs: Rhs) -> Self::Output;
}
```

`Rhs` (“right-hand side”) defaults to `Self`, which means, unless specified otherwise, the operator expects two values of the same type. The associated type `Output` lets each implementation state what comes out of the addition. For primitive numeric types the library supplies `impl Add for i32 { type Output = i32; … }`, `impl Add for f64 { type Output = f64; … }`, and so on.

2 The generic constraint `T: Add<Output = T>`  
When you write that bound inside the angle brackets you are telling the compiler:

“Accept any type `T` provided it implements `Add` where  
• the right-hand side defaults to `Self` (so `T + T` is defined), and  
• the associated type `Output` is exactly `T` as well.”

If you tried to call the function with, say, a tuple that yields something else after addition, the compiler would refuse because the bound would not be satisfied.

3 Monomorphisation and “zero-cost” generics  
A single monomorphic, concrete version of `add_two_numbers` must ultimately exist for every concrete type the program actually uses it with. Rust arranges that at compile time:

• It scans the call sites in `main`.  
• It sees one call with `i32`, another with `f64`.  
• It clones the function body twice, substituting `T` with `i32` in one copy and `f64` in the other.  
• The optimizer now treats those copies like any hand-written, non-generic functions.

Because all of that happens before the program is run, the machine code of the finished binary contains only specialised, direct calls—no boxing, no vtables, no dynamic dispatch. That is what people mean when they say Rust generics are “zero-cost”: you get the abstraction benefits without paying extra for them at runtime.

4 Operator overloading in action  
Inside the generic function body, the expression `a + b` is syntactic sugar. The compiler rewrites it to `<T as Add>::add(a, b)`. The type parameter constraint guarantees the method exists, and the monomorphised versions after substitution become `i32::add(a, b)` and `f64::add(a, b)`, respectively.

5 Why the signature isn’t `T: Add` alone  
With just `T: Add` the compiler would accept a type whose `+` returns a *different* type; for example `impl Add for &str { type Output = String; … }`. That would contradict the declared return type of the function (`-> T`). By adding the `Output = T` equality constraint we ensure the return type lines up with the argument type, keeping the API intuitive and sound.

Putting it all together, the file shows off how Rust combines expressive type constraints with compile-time code generation to let you write a single, high-level function that works efficiently for any number of concrete numeric types—and would work just as well for user-defined types that implement `Add` in a compatible way.
